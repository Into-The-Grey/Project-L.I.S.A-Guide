To test and demonstrate scheduling features, we can use publicly available calendar data. For example, many universities publish their [[Academic Calendars|academic calendars]] (with semester start/end dates, exam weeks, holidays) in iCalendar format. We could import a sample academic calendar (an `.ics` file) – for instance, an ICS file of a typical semester schedule or even generic ones like holiday calendars – to populate the assistant’s schedule. This gives realistic events (e.g., “Midterm Exam” on a date, “Spring Break” week, deadlines, etc.) to work with. Similarly, we can include a [[Sample Course Syllabus|sample course syllabus]] (maybe from an open course) that lists assignments and due dates. These data let the assistant have pre-filled events and deadlines that showcase how it manages academic commitments. The user can see a mock semester’s tasks and how reminders would work for them, without having to enter all those events manually. It’s a way to _demo the scheduling capability_ effectively. All such data is free – e.g., many .ics holiday calendars are downloadable and university calendars are public – and using them locally poses no issue.
