**Role in LISA:**

- Primary implementation language for the assistant’s core functionality (CLI, scheduler, data handling, NLP integration).
    
- Chosen for its extensive open-source ecosystem (e.g. `sched`, APScheduler, `sqlite3`, HuggingFace Transformers, GPT4All) and ease of writing both scripts and larger applications.
    

**Version & Environment:**

- Ubuntu Linux (20.04 LTS or later)
    
- Python 3.10+ (ensure compatibility with latest libraries)
    

**Key Libraries & Tools:**

- **CLI & Scheduling:**
    
    - `argparse` / `click` – command-line argument parsing
        
    - `sched` or **APScheduler** – task reminder scheduling
        
- **Data Storage:**
    
    - `json`, `csv` – simple file formats (Week 1)
        
    - `sqlite3` – local database (Week 6)
        
- **NLP & AI Models:**
    
    - **HuggingFace Transformers** – load offline LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama-2, etc.)
        
    - **GPT4All** – unified API for local chat models
        
    - **Duckling**, **dateparser** – date/time extraction
        
- **Notifications:**
    
    - `print` / CLI alerts (initial)
        
    - `notify-send` integration on Linux (optional desktop popup)
        
- **Optional Enhancements:**
    
    - `pyttsx3` / `eSpeak` – Text-to-Speech
        
    - Vosk / Whisper – Speech-to-Text
        

**Benefits of Using Python for LISA:**

1. **Extensive Library Support:**
   - Python offers a vast array of libraries and frameworks that simplify the development process. This includes libraries for natural language processing, machine learning, data handling, and more.
   - The availability of pre-built libraries reduces development time and effort, allowing developers to focus on implementing core functionalities.

2. **Ease of Use and Readability:**
   - Python's simple and readable syntax makes it easy for developers to write and maintain code. This is particularly beneficial for collaborative projects where multiple developers are working on the same codebase.
   - The ease of use also makes it easier to onboard new developers to the project.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Python is a cross-platform language, meaning that code written in Python can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This ensures that LISA can be deployed on different platforms without major modifications.
   - The cross-platform compatibility also allows for easier testing and debugging across different environments.

4. **Strong Community Support:**
   - Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem. This means that developers can find extensive documentation, tutorials, and support for any issues they encounter.
   - The strong community support also ensures that Python libraries and frameworks are regularly updated and maintained.

5. **Integration Capabilities:**
   - Python can easily integrate with other languages and technologies, making it a versatile choice for building complex applications. This includes integration with C/C++ for performance-critical components, as well as web technologies like JavaScript for building web interfaces.
   - The integration capabilities also allow for seamless communication between different components of LISA, such as the CLI, scheduler, and NLP models.

**Suggested Sections for This Note:**

1. **Installation**: setting up venv, installing dependencies
    
2. **Project Layout**: where Python code lives (`core/`, `modules/`)
    
3. **Running the CLI**: examples of `lisa` commands
    
4. **Scheduling & Notifications**: how reminders are triggered
    
5. **NLP Integration**: loading and querying LLMs offline
    
6. **Testing**: pytest setup for Python modules
