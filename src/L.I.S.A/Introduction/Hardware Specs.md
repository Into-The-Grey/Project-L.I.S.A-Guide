**Context in LISA:**

- Defines the local compute environment used to run and test LISA’s various components, especially the AI models.
    

**Key Components:**

- **CPU:**
    
    - AMD Ryzen Threadripper (e.g., 3960X/3970X) or Ryzen 9 series
        
    - 24–32 cores, high multi-thread performance for scheduling, data processing, and inference orchestration
        
- **Memory (RAM):**
    
    - 64–128 GB DDR4/DDR5
        
    - Ensures multiple AI models (e.g., a 7 B LLM + embedding index) can reside in memory simultaneously without swapping
        
- **GPU:**
    
    - NVIDIA mid-range cards (e.g., RTX 3060/3070/4060/4070)
        
    - At least 8 GB VRAM; 12 + GB preferred for quantized 7 B–13 B models
        
    - Enables faster inference through CUDA; compatible with PyTorch*, TensorFlow*, and other frameworks
        
- **Storage:**
    
    - SSD (NVMe preferred) for fast model loading and database access
        
    - At least 1 TB capacity to store models (several GB each), datasets, and logs
        
- **Networking (offline):**
    
    - Gigabit Ethernet or reliable Wi-Fi for local LAN access (for web UI on other devices)
        
    - No Internet dependency for inference or data fetch
        

**Model Memory Requirements:**

- **Mistral 7B Instruct:** Requires approximately 5-6 GB of VRAM when quantized to 4-bit. For optimal performance, 8 GB of VRAM is recommended.
- **TinyLlama 1.1B:** Requires minimal VRAM, around 1-2 GB, making it suitable for lightweight tasks.
- **GPT4All Ecosystem:** Depending on the model, VRAM requirements can range from 4 GB to 12 GB. For instance, GPT4All-J (6 B) requires around 6 GB of VRAM.
- **Llama-2 7B/13B:** The 7B model requires around 8 GB of VRAM, while the 13B model requires around 12 GB of VRAM when quantized.

**Optimization Tips:**

- **Mixed Precision:** Enable mixed precision training and inference to reduce memory usage and improve performance. This can be done using libraries like NVIDIA's Apex or PyTorch's native mixed precision support.
- **Model Quantization:** Quantize models to 4-bit or 8-bit to significantly reduce memory usage. Tools like `bitsandbytes` can be used for this purpose.
- **Memory Pinning:** Use memory pinning techniques to ensure that frequently accessed data remains in RAM, reducing latency.

**Benchmarking:**

- **Inference Throughput:** Measure the number of inferences per second that the system can handle. This can be done using tools like `torchbenchmark` for PyTorch models.
- **Latency:** Measure the time taken for a single inference. Lower latency is crucial for real-time applications. Tools like `timeit` in Python can be used for this purpose.

**Troubleshooting:**

- **GPU/Driver Issues:** Ensure that the correct GPU drivers are installed and up to date. Use tools like `nvidia-smi` to check the status of the GPU.
- **Memory Errors:** If encountering out-of-memory errors, consider reducing the batch size or using model quantization to lower memory usage.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks by profiling the code using tools like `cProfile` in Python.
