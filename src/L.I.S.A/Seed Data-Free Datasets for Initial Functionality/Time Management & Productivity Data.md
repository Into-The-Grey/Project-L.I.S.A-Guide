To simulate the scheduling and advice component, we can include datasets or reference materials about time management. For instance, a [[Kaggle Time Management Dataset|“Time Management and Productivity Insights”]] dataset on Kaggle provides detailed insights into how people allocate time between work, leisure, and well-being. While this is more of an analytics dataset, we can glean typical patterns or tips from it (e.g., the importance of breaks, average time spent on tasks, etc.). Additionally, public articles or lists of [[Time Management Tips and Techniques|time management tips and techniques]] (such as [[Pomodoro Technique]] descriptions, [[Eisenhower Matrix]] explanations) can be included in a knowledge base. These could allow the assistant to give advice like “Try focusing in 25-minute intervals (Pomodoro technique) for better productivity,” if asked for time management help. Including a few well-known [[Productivity Guides|productivity guides or datasets]] (which are often freely available on blogs or as open e-books) can enrich the assistant’s ability to coach the user in staying on schedule.
