We can also create or use a small dummy dataset of tasks to simulate a [[To-Do List|to-do list]]. For example, a CSV of tasks with fields like Task, Category, Due Date, Priority. This can be used to test the system’s import/export functionality (if we allow importing tasks from a CSV or similar). While not from an external source, it’s useful to prepare such structured dummy data for integration tests. If looking for an external source, the old [[Enron Email Dataset|Enron email dataset]] (while not directly time management) contains scheduling emails that could be parsed; however, that’s too complex for our needs. Simpler is better: e.g., a set of example tasks (like “Finish research paper, due 2025-05-30, Category: Study”) can be treated as a dataset to load initially so the assistant isn’t empty on first run.
