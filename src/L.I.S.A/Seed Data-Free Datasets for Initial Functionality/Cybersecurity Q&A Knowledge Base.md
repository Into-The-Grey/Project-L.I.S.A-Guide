Utilize a dataset of question-answer pairs on cybersecurity topics to give the assistant a knowledge reservoir. A great source is the [[Security StackExchange]] archive – for example, a [[Kaggle cybersecurity-qa dataset|“cybersecurity-qa”]] contains curated Q&A pairs from Security StackExchange focused on infosec topics. This dataset is ideal for an offline academic assistant: we can load it into a local database or even just a JSON file. The assistant can then search this Q&A when the user asks a security question. This provides realistic answers and explanations for common cybersecurity questions (e.g., definitions, best practices, explanations of concepts) without internet access. It’s essentially a local Stack Overflow for security. We might also extract [[Cybersecurity Notes or Cheat-Sheets|cybersecurity notes or cheat-sheets]] from open resources (for example, [[OWASP Top 10]] documentation, [[MITRE ATT&CK]] descriptions, etc., which are publicly available) to have reference material the assistant can cite or summarize. These resources help simulate a knowledgeable tutor for the _study_ module.
