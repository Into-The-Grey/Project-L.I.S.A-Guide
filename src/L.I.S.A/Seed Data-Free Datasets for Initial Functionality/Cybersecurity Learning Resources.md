Apart from Q&A, having some structured learning content could be useful. For example, a list of key terms and definitions (maybe from an open [[Glossary of Cybersecurity Terms|glossary of cybersecurity terms]]), or a dataset like [[MITRE CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)]] list which describes common security flaws, or [[CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog]] (which is public domain data of vulnerabilities). Such data could allow the assistant to answer “Tell me about CWE-89” or “What are the top exploited vulnerabilities this year?” purely from offline data. Even if not used in initial implementation, having these datasets ready means we can later add features like “security bulletin updates” by parsing this data. For coursework help, another idea is using an open [[Cybersecurity Textbook or Lecture Notes|textbook or lecture notes]]. For instance, the [[Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)]] has extensive documentation (openly available) which could be ingested so the assistant can answer questions about web security topics. Similarly, any freely available lecture slides or notes (if appropriately licensed) could be loaded to simulate the user’s own notes.
