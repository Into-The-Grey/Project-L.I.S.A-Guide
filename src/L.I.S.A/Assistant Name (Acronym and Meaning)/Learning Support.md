**Role:**  
Enables LISA’s study module to act as an offline tutor and reference for coursework, especially cybersecurity.

**Features:**
- Static Q&A retrieval from curated datasets (e.g., Security StackExchange).  
- Retrieval-augmented summaries via local LLM.  
- Flashcard/quiz generation for self-testing.  
- Future: integrate lecture notes, glossaries (OWASP Top 10, MITRE ATT&CK).
- Personalized study plans based on user progress and performance.
- Interactive tutorials and guided learning sessions.
- Integration with external study resources and tools.

**Examples of Usage:**

1. **Q&A Retrieval:**
   - "LISA, what is the OWASP Top 10?"
   - "LISA, explain the concept of SQL injection."
   - "LISA, what are the best practices for securing a web application?"

2. **Flashcard Generation:**
   - "LISA, create flashcards for the latest cybersecurity concepts."
   - "LISA, generate a quiz on network security."
   - "LISA, make flashcards for the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities."

3. **Summarization:**
   - "LISA, summarize the key points from this cybersecurity article."
   - "LISA, provide a brief overview of the MITRE ATT&CK framework."
   - "LISA, summarize the latest security trends and threats."

4. **Personalized Study Plans:**
   - "LISA, create a study plan for my upcoming cybersecurity exam."
   - "LISA, adjust my study plan based on my recent quiz performance."

5. **Interactive Tutorials:**
   - "LISA, guide me through setting up a secure web server."
   - "LISA, provide a step-by-step tutorial on network security basics."

**Benefits:**
- No Internet needed—data resides locally.  
- Instant access to definitions, best practices, concept explanations.  
- Interactive study modes (quizzes, flashcards) to reinforce learning.
- Enhanced understanding through retrieval-augmented summaries.
- Convenient and efficient study support tailored to individual needs.
- Personalized study plans to optimize learning and retention.
- Access to interactive tutorials and guided learning sessions.
