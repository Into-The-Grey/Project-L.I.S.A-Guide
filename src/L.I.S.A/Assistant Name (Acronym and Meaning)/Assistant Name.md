**LISA** stands for **Learning and Intelligent Scheduling Assistant**. It serves as both the project’s brand and a mnemonic for its core capabilities:

- **Learning & Intelligent:**  
  - “Learning” emphasizes the study-support features (e.g., cybersecurity Q&A, flashcards).  
  - “Intelligent” signifies the AI-driven parsing, scheduling, and Q&A.  

- **Scheduling Assistant:**  
  - Manages reminders, tasks, and calendar events.  
  - Provides notifications and integrates offline NLP for natural-language task entry.

**Key Attributes of the Name:**

1. **Concise & Memorable**  
2. **Friendly Persona** (non-cringe, sounds like a human name)  
3. **Offline Emphasis** (“Local Intelligent Scheduling Assistant”)  
4. **Extensible Identity**—stays relevant as LISA grows with new modules.
