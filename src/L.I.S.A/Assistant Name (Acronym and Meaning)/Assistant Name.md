**LISA** stands for **Learning and Intelligent Scheduling Assistant**. It serves as both the project’s brand and a mnemonic for its core capabilities:

- **Learning & Intelligent:**  
  - “Learning” emphasizes the study-support features (e.g., cybersecurity Q&A, flashcards).  
  - “Intelligent” signifies the AI-driven parsing, scheduling, and Q&A.  

- **Scheduling Assistant:**  
  - Manages reminders, tasks, and calendar events.  
  - Provides notifications and integrates offline NLP for natural-language task entry.

**Key Attributes of the Name:**

1. **Concise & Memorable**  
2. **Friendly Persona** (non-cringe, sounds like a human name)  
3. **Offline Emphasis** (“Local Intelligent Scheduling Assistant”)  
4. **Extensible Identity**—stays relevant as LISA grows with new modules.

**Examples of Usage in the Project:**

1. **Task Management:**  
   - "LISA, remind me to submit the project report by Friday."
   - "LISA, schedule a meeting with the team at 3 PM tomorrow."

2. **Learning Support:**  
   - "LISA, what is the OWASP Top 10?"
   - "LISA, generate flashcards for the latest cybersecurity concepts."

3. **Natural Language Processing:**  
   - "LISA, parse this text and extract the key dates and events."
   - "LISA, summarize this document for me."

4. **Offline Capabilities:**  
   - "LISA, provide a summary of the local cybersecurity dataset."
   - "LISA, run the local language model to answer this question."
